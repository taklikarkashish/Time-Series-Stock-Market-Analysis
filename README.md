# 📈 Stock Market Time Series Forecasting Project

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project involves **time series analysis and forecasting of stock market trends** using historical stock price data. The main goal is to apply and compare different statistical and deep learning models to predict future stock prices and uncover meaningful patterns.

You will explore methods such as **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **LSTM**, covering a complete data science pipeline—from data collection to model deployment-ready visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand time series components: trend, seasonality, noise.
- Preprocess and visualize stock market data.
- Build and evaluate forecasting models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet, LSTM.
- Compare model performances using error metrics.
- Generate insights and predictions using visual dashboards.
